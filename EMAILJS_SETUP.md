## Important Notes

- **Free Tier Limits**: EmailJS free tier allows 200 emails per month
- **Email Delivery**: Make sure to check spam folders initially
- **Template Variables**: All template variables ({{variable_name}}) must match the ones sent from the form
- **Error Handling**: The form will show an error message if sending fails
- **Fallback**: Users are provided with the direct email address if sending fails

## Troubleshooting

**Email not received?**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify template variables match exactly
- Check EmailJS dashboard for send logs
- Ensure service is properly connected

**Form shows error?**
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Verify all three IDs are correct in emailService.js
- Make sure EmailJS service is active

**Still having issues?**
- Check EmailJS documentation: https://www.emailjs.com/docs/
- Verify email service connection in EmailJS dashboard
- Test with a simple template first

## Security Note

The configuration in this setup is safe for frontend use. EmailJS public keys are meant to be exposed in client-side code. However, consider setting up rate limiting in your EmailJS dashboard to prevent abuse.
